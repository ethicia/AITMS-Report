%*****************************Abstract*************************************************************
\chapter*{Abstract\markboth{Abstract}{Abstract}}
\hspace*{0.5in}Congestion of traffic in urban areas and smart cities is one of the major issues with increasing population in metropolitan areas. Traffic jams are not only a cause of delay and inconvenience in day to day life but also a major source of noise and air pollution.
Modern approaches to deal with this issue range from complicated software handling dozens of traffic signals throughout an entire city to simpler single-intersection solutions. However these can be costly, difficult to implement and may require a lot of manual monitoring.\\
\\
\hspace*{0.5in}In this project, we propose a traffic management system which uses concepts from artificial intelligence and graph theory to control and optimize traffic flow. Our aim is to optimize traffic flow on a small to medium scale in a manner which adapts to the real time changes in traffic.\\

\chapter{Introduction}
\hspace*{0.5in}This chapter describes the term M-Learning and introduces the concept of M-Learning Framework. It also gives the overview of the M-Learning Framework which describes the deliverables of the project. We have code named our project as Maggie.\\

\hspace*{0.5in} Project Objective. 
%*************************Chapter 2************************
\chapter{Literature Survey}

\hspace*{0.5in}In this chapter we will see the various studies and research conducted on key concepts which are essential to create and understand our proposed system.

\section{You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection, Joseph Redmon, et al. \cite{paper1}}
\hspace*{0.5in}Object detection comprises locating specific types of objects in an image or video. The output of a typical object detection algorithm consists of bounding box coordinates and a label of the object. YOLO (You Only Look Once) model consists of an extremely fast unified architecture for object detection. It makes use of a single neural network for predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities from a full image in a single evaluation. Hence, making it ideal for object detection in real time applications.\\

\section{Traffic Congestion Detection from Camera Images using Deep Convolution Neural Networks, Pranamesh Chakraborty, et al. \cite{paper2}}
\hspace*{0.5in}Recent improvements in computer vision algorithms have led to closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras emerging as an important data source for determining the state of traffic congestion. To detect congestion in a traffic CCTV footage YOLO, a state-of-the-art real-time object detection algorithm is used. In the above mentioned paper, several object detection techniques were tested for congestion detection out of which YOLO showed the most promising results.\\

\section{Smart Control of Traffic Light Using Artificial Intelligence, Mihir M. Gandhi, et al. \cite{paper3}}
\hspace*{0.5in}Traffic signal timing plays an important role in controlling flow and efficiency of traffic.
The above system makes use of vehicle count obtained from CCTV footage and uses it to  optimize green signal timing for each lane to optimize traffic flow at a single intersection. Our aim is to create a similar system and extend the scope of optimization to multiple adjacent intersections.\\

\section{Comparison of Current Practical Adaptive Traffic Control Systems, Hongyun Chen, et al. \cite{paper4}}
\hspace*{0.5in}Existing Adaptive Traffic Control Systems (ACTS) such as SCOOT, SCAT, OPAC, RHODES, etc. are being adapted by major cities in developed and developing countries. They can cover up to hundreds (OPAC) to even thousands (SCOOT, SCAT) of intersections. However, their implementation includes installation of additional sensors and can lead to very heavy costs which isn't feasible for smaller cities. Additionally, these systems do not take into consideration challenges such as power failure, non lane following traffic and mixed traffic which are common in Indian roads.\\
\hspace*{0.5in}The aforementioned systems provide key algorithmic insights for developing a more feasible ACTS model. Furthermore, usage of existing inputs such as CCTV needs to be emphasized over installation of new sensors in order to help reduce costs.\\

\section{Summary}
\hspace*{0.5in}In this chapter, we reviewed research done on key concepts such as object detection and implementation of artificial intelligence with traffic signals which are essential to our proposed system. We also studied existing solutions, their inner workings as well as their advantages and disadvantages.\\

\section{Summary}
\hspace*{0.5in}In this chapter we described the implementation details of the project plan for Semester I and Semester II. We also studied the necessary functions and the desirable functions of M-Learning Framework.
%*****************************Chapter5***************
\chapter{Design}
\hspace*{0.5in}This chapter describes the Software Requirement Specification (SRS) to be implemented for Maggie. It also explains the architecture of the system and external interface requirements. We have also described the Risk assessment strategy and the Data Flow Diagram which explains the flow of the project.
\section{Software Requirement Specifications}
\hspace*{0.5in} The Software Requirement Specification describes the scope of the project, operating environment, user characteristics, design and constraints. It also elaborates the system architecture of the M-Learning Framework.

\subsection{Project Scope}

\hspace*{0.5in}Mobile devices are becoming ever more important due in main to their ubiquity. The number of mobile phone subscribers will increase to 5 billion in 2012. Because of the growth of smart-phones in developed nations and mobile services in poor nations. Industry predictions are that the sales of smart-phones will surpass that of ordinary mobile phones. The definition and scope of mobile learning is central to the debate over the pedagogic use of such devices. “Mobile learning framework– as we understand it is not about delivering content to mobile devices but instead about the processes of coming to know and being able to operate successfully in and across, new and ever changing contexts and learning spaces”. “M-Learning Framework  is understood as the process of coming to know and being able to operate successfully  in and across ever changing contexts and learning spaces as well as understanding and knowing how to utilize  our everyday life worlds as learning spaces. It is viewed as a process of meaning making through communication and conversation across multiple contexts among people within a triangle of social structures, cultural practices and agency as well as an augmentation of the inner, conceptual and outer semiotic resources – increasingly with and through mobile devices\cite{paper2}.”
\\The scope of Artificially Intelligent Traffic Management System can be considered as a collection of reusable piece of code, style-sheets and include files that can be used by the developer for developing learning applications and also considering the following points :
\begin{itemize}
\item{Making learners mobile so that they are able to expand their horizons.}
\item{Engaging learners on their own ground and addressing them as people who are learners already and    as knowledge makers.}
\item{Providing them full recognition in their position and achievements in their lives; as well as of their position as learners and makers of knowledge. In this context, learning means being mobile, being able to change.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Operating Environment}
\hspace*{0.5in}We propose an M-Learning Framework for developers to develop learning application with ease of operations that will save the time for developing the application as the reusable piece of code will be provided in our framework. Furthermore, this application can be used by the user for learning anywhere and anytime required with interactivity and portability.

\subsection{User Classes and Characteristics}
\hspace*{0.5in}The user who is going to operate the system should have the tablet or phone having android as the base operating system.

\subsection{Design and Implementation Constraints}
\hspace*{0.5in}Using mobile devices like phones, tablets, and laptops (with touch interface) has a very different set of challenges. The issue is not whether you have larger screen - but fundamentally they are different.\\
\\ Battery life, screen size, form factor, variations in keyboard availability and dynamically changing orientation (horizontal or vertical positioning done by user) present using set of issues to be dealt with. The sponsoring organization Cognifront develops teaching tools software as well as self learning aids for students. Keeping in mind vision of Cognifront, it was necessary to innovate the space where maximum number of users would benefit. Mobile devices including phones and tablets are the most prominent majority - and also have high projections for the future. So it is imperative that we have to have good tools for content creation and dissemination. Teachers who are our prime focus must have some superb tools to create their M-Learning modules. And students, who will eventually consume these modules, must have excellent tools to use these M-Learning units. Out of this exact need, Maggie was born. Maggie must be extremely portable, FREE to use and open source. Our philosophy is to make world a better place.\\
\hspace*{0.5in}Following are the merits of the design implementation :
\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Portability:}  As it is M-Learning, on the move learning is achieved anywhere and anytime.}
\item{\textbf{Delivery Mechanism:}  It is convenient to develop application and even very easy to use.}
\item{\textbf{User-friendly:}  It is user-friendly due to the use of mobile devices like tablets.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
\hspace*{0.5in}The Framework is capable of allowing the developer to develop the learning application with ease and import it on the tablet(Android OS)  . This application developed by the vendor will allow the user to use it with high power of interactivity and portability. The commercialization of the tablets  may take time. It incorporated best practice in M-Learning research into a practical framework of M-Learning design requirements.

\newpage
\section{System Architecture}

\hspace*{0.5in}In the current scenario, there are the various hardware platforms available as shown above. Above these the Operating Systems reside. The application programming interfaces are above the Operating Systems and provide the interaction between the applications built on them and the underlying Operating System and the Hardware Platform. There layer above the API is occupied by the M-Learning framework on which the applications are proposed to be built. Following is the detailed description of each layer.
\\
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=6in,height=5in]{./metbkc}
\caption{M-Learning System Architecture}
\end{figure}

\hspace*{0.5in}An \textbf{operating system (OS)} is a set of programs that manages computer hardware resources, and provides common services for application software. The operating system is the most important type of system software in a computer system. Without an operating system, a user cannot run an application program on their computer, unless the application program is self booting. An \textbf{Application Programming Interface (API)} is a particular set of rules (code) and specifications that software programs can follow to communicate with each other.I t serves as an interface between different software programs and facilitates their interaction, similar to the way the user interface facilitates interaction between humans and computers. An API can be created for applications, libraries, operating systems, etc., as a way of defining their vocabularies and resources request conventions (e.g. function-calling conventions). It may include specifications for routines, data structures, object classes, and protocols used to communicate between the consumer program and the implementer program of the API.\\
\hspace*{0.5in}An API consist of a core set of packages and classes. As shown in the Figure 4.1 the applications will be built using the M-Learning Framework. These applications will be built by importing the libraries, include files and the style sheets developed as a whole framework. The framework is developed considering the developer's point of view that is to be able to develop the applications by putting in less time and efforts. Thus the developer will access the API’s present in the framework and develop the applications by writing small amount of code.

\section{External Interface Requirement}

\subsection{User Interfaces}

\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Desktop Application:}  Using the desktop application the end user will be able to provide the M-Learning content for the application to be developed using the M-Learning Framework.}
\item{\textbf{M-Learning Application:}  The M-Learning application will provide a Graphical User Interface which will consist of several screens which the end user will be able to navigate to consume learning.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hardware Interfaces}
\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Mobile Devices:} The M-Learning applications built using the framewok will be deployed on mobile devices like smart-phones and tablets supporting Android operating system version 2.2 and above.}
\item{\textbf{SD card:}  The M-Learning application will load the learning content stored on the SD card. End user will be able to write on the SD card as well.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Communication Interfaces}
\hspace*{0.5in}The M-Learning application will be communicating through the internet via a Transmission Control Protocol of the TCP/IP suite for Social Networking Interface(SNI) and video streaming.

\section{Software System Attribute}
\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Reliability:} The M-Learning applications built using the framewok should ensure that the SD card is mounted on the device. Internet facility must be available for using the feature of Social Networking Interface and video streaming.}
\item{\textbf{Availability:} The M-Learning application shall be available and running in a stable state at all times.}
\item{\textbf{Maintainability:}  The M-Learning framework shall be available to the developers for developing theri own M-Learning applications.}
\item{\textbf{Portability:}  The M-Learning application can be used regardless of the time and location constraints.}

\end{itemize}

\section{Nonfunctional Requirement}
\hspace*{0.5in} M-learning systems represent a broad class of software systems with complex characteristics that tend to make evaluation difficult. The educational potential of mlearning contents, both as a learning and teaching tool, is widely acknowledged, and various initiatives undertaken encourage the integration of educational multimedia resources in school practice.\\
\hspace*{0.5in}There  is a need to develop richer models for capturing and analysing NFRs in Software Engineering. However this not a simple enterprise.
Mobile e-Learning is so new that we are only beginning to see the potential of mobile devices in training and performance support.\\
\hspace*{0.5in}Following are the Non Functional Requirements of M-Learning Framework:
\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Small screen size of mobile devices:} Mobile devices are small, portable and compact. They can often fit in a pocket or purse. Unlike laptop computers, which are expensive, heavy and power hungry, mobile devices are relatively low-cost, lightweight, and some work a very long time on a charge or a couple of standard disposable or rechargeable batteries.
The small screen size of mobile devices  makes some people questions their worth as e-Learning delivery tools. The truth is, some of these devices also have good audio capability,allowing students to listen to a narrated
lecture, rather than read material on a small screen.}
\item{\textbf{Input capabilities:} Input capabilities  of some of these devices, questioning students’ ability to enter large amounts of text into a device to take notes or answer an essay-type question..}
\item{\textbf{Extremely Adaptable:} Many of these devices, however, are extremely adaptable and can be attached to a full-size folding keyboard that makes entering large amounts of information every bit as fast as with a conventional computer.}
\end{itemize}
\hspace*{0.5in}As mobile devices evolve and people discover new ways in which mobile devices functionalities can be applied to training, mobile e-Learning will likely become something increasingly different from conventional e-Learning.

\section{Risk Assessment}
\hspace*{0.5in}The Figure 5.2 shows a very simple framework for assessing individual risks that have been identified.
\newpage
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=5in,height=4in]{./metbkc}
\caption{Risk Assessment}
\end{figure}
\hspace*{0.5in}We have adopted this framework for the categorization of risk areas for M-learning Framework. The two main axes represent potential impact and likelihood. There are only two values on each axis: high or low. This forces a simple binary judgment to be made about any risk. There is a third dimension, also binary, that measures whether the speed of onset of the risk is considered to be slow or fast. This third dimension is rarely alluded to in the guidance literature but it makes an important difference to how a risk is treated.\\
\hspace*{0.5in}This framework identifies just eight possible outcomes. These consist of the four labeled areas of the diagram, A, B, C and D, together with an indication of whether the onset of the risk is slow (s) or fast (f).Determining where a risk fits on this model requires making simple but significant judgments about each risk. Often, the placing of a risk within this framework can be achieved by making a considered judgment about appropriate reactions. Assuming that a particular risk is to be treated (rather than tolerated, transferred or the associated activity terminated) there are natural responses to each category, as given in the following table:
\newpage
\begin{table} [htb]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|p{3cm}|p{10cm}|}\hline
\textbf{Category}	&\textbf{Response}\\\hline\hline
Af &“All hands to the pump” – drop everything and deal with this\\\hline
As &Major priority to take evasive action. Develop “worst case scenario” plan\\\hline
Bf &Fire fighting: contain the crisis and implement a recovery plan\\\hline
Bs &Develop a recovery plan. Monitor early warning signs carefully\\\hline
Cf &Minor but regular problem: develop rapid response capability and put resources into determining causes \\\hline
Cs &Minor but regular problem with early warning signs. Develop response capability and put resources into determining causes\\\hline
D &Monitor to ensure it does not move in the direction of A, B or C \\\hline

\end{tabular}
\caption{Risk Assessment category}
\label{tab:nnwork}
\end{table}

\hspace*{0.5in} Following is the list of risks identified:
\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Insufficient or uncertain human resources }\\
\textbf{Af:} High likelihood, high impact, fast onset. \\
Significant anecdotal evidence exists that the human resources and time needed to create content is frequently underestimated. Even with ready-made material, creating content is extremely time-intensive. Also, projects cannot assume that after creation of a content infrastructure, subject experts will be able to create M-Learning content independently - they will require guidance and support, which is likely to increase demand for human resources both from the project team and from parent institutions.}
\item{\textbf{Technical limitations of solutions reached or exceeded}\\
 \textbf{As:}High likelihood, high impact, slow onset.\\
The technologies used by some of the projects are at the leading edge of development and may not always meet prior expectations.\\
\\
\hspace*{0.5in}Several of the projects depend on technology and systems development and implementation work and in a few cases a particular technology turned out not to be capable of providing the required solution at its current stage of development.}
\item{\textbf{Failure to meet technical standards}\\
 \textbf{Bs:}Low likelihood, high impact, slow onset.\\
The effect of failure to meet technical standards is only likely to be felt once the project is completed. Some concerns were expressed regarding the level of ‘maturity’ of potentially relevant emerging standards, and the uncertainties this brings for project.}
\item{\textbf{Poor Quality Assurance}\\
\textbf{D:} Low likelihood, low impact (but could become a problem if not attended to)\\
Quality assurance should be built into the project management process. However, there may be specific quality issues associated, for example, with projects producing M-Learning materials. There is a particular issue with Learning Objects, their definition and reuse.}
\end{itemize}
\section{Data Flow Diagram}
\hspace*{0.5in} The Data Flow Diagram of the M-Learning Application developed using the M-Learning Framework is as shown in Figure 5.3. The Data Flow Diagram explains the flow of information in the project that is it indicates from where information (data) is reseived (inputs) and where information is send (outputs).\\
\newpage

\section{Summary}
\hspace*{0.5in} In this chapter we studied the operating environment and the user classes and characteristics which describes the scope of the project. We have also described the software system attributes and various nonfunctional requirements.
%*****************************Chapter 6******************

\chapter{Modeling}

\hspace*{0.5in} This chapter includes the various modeling techniques which describes the various users of the M-Learning Framework and M-Learning application. It also describes the functionality of the different features of the M-Learning framework.

\section{Use Case Diagram}
\hspace*{0.5in} A use case diagram is a type of behavioral diagram defined by the UML created from a use case analysis. Its purpose is to present a graphical overview of the functionality provided by a system in terms of actors, their goals represented as use case and any dependencies between those use cases.\\
\hspace*{0.5in}Four modeling elements make up the use case diagram; these are:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Actors:} Actors refer to a type of users, users are people who use the system. In this case student, teacher developer are the users of the framework and application}
\item{\textbf{Use cases:} A use case defines behavioral features of a system. Each use case is named using a verb phrase that express a goal of the system. The name may appear inside or outside the ellipse.}
\item{\textbf{Associations:} An association is a relationship between an actor and a use case. The relationship is represented by a line between an actor and a use case.}
\item{\textbf{The include relationship:} It is analogous to a call between objects. One use case requires some type of behavior which is fully defined in  another use case.}
\end{itemize}

\section{Class Diagram}
\hspace*{0.5in}The class diagram shows the building blocks of any object oriented system. Class diagram depicts a static view of the model or part of the model, describing what attributes and behavior it has rather that the detailing the methods of achieving operations. Class diagrams are most useful in illustrating relationships between classes and interfaces. Generalizations, aggregations, and associations are all valuable in reflecting interface, composition or usage and connections receptively.\\
\hspace*{0.5in}The Figure 6.2 illustrates aggregation relationships between classes. The lighter aggregation indicates that the class ObjectExplorer used ThumbNail, but does not necessarily contain an instance of it.The strong, composite aggregations by the other connectors indicate ownership or containment of the source classes by the target. Class, for example VideoPlayer  values will be contained in TableOfContents.

\newpage
\section{Activity Diagram}
\hspace*{0.5in}Use cases show what your system should do. Activity diagrams allow you to specify how your system will accomplish its goals. Activity diagrams show high-level actions chained together to represent a process occurring in your system. An activity diagram is essentially a flowchart, showing flow of control from activity to activity. Unlike a traditional flowchart, an activity diagram shows concurrency as well as branches of control. Activity diagrams focus on the dynamic flow of a system.\\
\hspace*{0.5in}An activity is the process being modeled, such as using the M-Learning application. An action is a step in the overall activity, such as select subject, select topic. The flow of the activity is shown using arrowed lines called edges or paths. The arrowhead on an activity edge shows the direction of flow from one action to the next. A line going into a node is called as an incoming edge, and a line exiting a node is called an outgoing edge. Fork Node is used to show the parallel or concurrent actions. Fork has single incoming flows and multiple outgoing flows. The join means that all incoming actions must finish before the flow can proceed past the join. Join has multiple incoming flows and single outgoing flow.
\newpage

\section{Sequence Diagram}
\hspace*{0.5in}The sequence diagram is used primarily to show the interactions between objects in the sequential order that those interactions occur. Developers typically think sequence diagrams were meant exclusively for them. However, an organization's business staff can find sequence diagrams useful to communicate how the business currently works by showing how various business objects interact.Sequence diagrams illustrate how objects interact with each other. They focus on message sequences, that is, how messages are sent and received between a number of objects. The main purpose of sequence diagram is to show the order of events between the parts of system that are involved in particular interaction.\\
\hspace*{0.5in}The basic element of sequence diagram is collection of participants, that is, the parts of the system that interact with each other during the sequence. The participants are arranged horizontally with no two participants overlapping each other. in Figure 6.4 developer, framework, applications are some examples of participants. A message is communication between objects that conveys information with the expectation that action will be taken. An event is any point in an interaction where something occurs. Message can flow in whatever direction makes sense for the required interaction from left to right, right to left, or even back to the Message Caller itself.


\newpage
\section{Package Diagram}
\hspace*{0.5in} Package diagrams are used to reflect the organizations of packages and their elements, and provide a visualization of their corresponding name space. Following are the elemts of package diagram:
\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Package:} A package is a namespace as well as an element that can be contained in other package's namespace. A package can own or merge with other package, and its elements can be imported into a package's namespace.}
\item{\textbf{Class:} A class is a representation of objects, that reflects their structure and behavior within the system. It is a template from which actual running instances are created. A class may have attributes and methods.}
\item{\textbf{Interface:} An interface is a specification of behavior that implements agree to meet, it is a contract. By implementing an interface, classes are guaranteed to support a required behavior.}
\item{\textbf{Object:} An object is an instance of a class at runtime. Objects are often used in analysis to represent the numerous artifacts and items that exist in any business.}
\item{\textbf{Table:} A table is a stereotyped class. It is drawn with a small table icon in the upper right corner. A table element has special properties dialog with settings for database type and ability to set column information and data related operations such as triggers and indices.}
\end{itemize}


\newpage
\section{State Machine Diagram}
\hspace*{0.5in}A state machine diagram models the behavior of a single object, specifying the sequence of events that an object goes through during its lifetime in response to events. In figure 6.6, the state machine diagram shows the states the that a video or an audio file goes through during its lifetime. The file can be in one of the four states Play, Pause, Seek or Stop. It can respond to the events Play, Pause, Seek and Stop. Notice that not all events are valid in all states. For example; if a video is stopped, you cannot pause it until you play it. Also notice that a state transition can have a guard condition attached. If the file is stopped it can only respond to the play event.

\newpage
\section{Object Diagram}
\hspace*{0.5in}In UML, an object diagram is a diagram that shows complete or partial view of the structure of a modeled system at a specific time. This snapshot focuses on some particular set of object instances and attributes and link between instances. Object diagrams are useful in understanding class diagrams. They don't show anything architecturally different to class diagram, but reflects multiplicity and roles. Basically an object diagram shows a set of objects and their relationships at a specific point in time.\\
\hspace*{0.5in}To draw an object diagram, the first thing is to add the actual objects themselves. Object notation is actually very simple if one is familiar with class notations; an object is shown with a rectangle just like a class, but to show that this is an instance of a class rather than the class itself, the title is underlined. An object is representation of an entity. Each object in  a system has three characteristics: state, behavior and identity. The state of an object is one of the possible conditions in which it may exist, the state of an object typically changes over time.
\newpage


\newpage
\section{Component Diagram}
\hspace*{0.5in}Component diagram are one of the two kinds of diagrams found in modeling the physical aspects of object oriented systems. A component diagram shows organization and dependencies among set of components. Component diagram can be seen to model the static implementation view of a system. This involves modeling the physical things that resides on a node, such as executables, libraries, tables, files and documents.\\
\hspace*{0.5in}Component diagram shows a set of components and their relationships. Graphically a component diagram is a collection of vertices and arcs. Component diagrams commonly contain,
\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Components}}
\item{\textbf{Interfaces}}
\item{\textbf{Dependency, generalization, association and realization relationships.}}
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\section{Deployment Diagram}
\hspace*{0.5in}he deployment diagram depicts the runtime architecture of devices, execution environments and artifacts that reside in this architecture. It is the ultimate physical description of the system topology, describing the structure of the hardware units and the software taht executes on each unit. The deployment diagram shows how a system will be physically deployed in the hardware environment. Its purpose is to show where the different components of the system will physically run and how they will communicate with each other.

\section{Summary}
\hspace*{0.5in}Thus we saw the various modeling techniques used for the design of M-Learning Framework and the M-Learning Applications.

%*****************************Chapter 7******************
\chapter{Implementation and Results}
\hspace*{0.5in}This chapter consists of the various implementation details and snapshots of the M-Learning Application developed using the M-Learning Framework.

\section{Implementation Details}
\hspace*{0.5in}This section describes the various features of the Maggie and also describes the implementation methods. Following are some of the features explained with their implementation details:\\
\begin{itemize}

\item{\textbf{Multilingual Application:}}The Multilingual feature is one of the most important features provided by the framework. The framework provides support for the Hindi language along with English; which is a primary language. The framework can provide support for more languages if required. This is implemented using the language packs of the respective language. Using the Language button on the transparent bar the user can switch between the languages. The user input is recorded in a text file and depending upon the user language selection the typeface of the content titles is changed. The content like theory animations also can be changed to respective language if recorded in that language.

\item{\textbf{Social Networking Interface (SNI):}} The SNI consists of Twitter and Facebook. This implementation requires the supporting archives and libraries for both Twitter and Facebook. The Twitter and Facebook provides the app interface to facilitate the interaction and related activities. The authentication is done using these app interfaces.The library Twitter 4J is required for the Twitter SNI Support. The OAuth Authentication is used for the authentication. This requires signing up for the Twitter App which provides with the consumer key, secret key and callback url. Using this authentication is done. When the framework app user first uses the Twitter, it asks for the authorization to the Twitter App and then after the authentication the user is directed to his/her account. Then the user can publish the posts. 

\item{\textbf{Logger:}}The Logger is basically used for the keep track of the usage of the framework application. It logs the activities performed by the user to a text file on the SD card. It stores information like the Device Manufacturer, Device Name, Android Operating System version, Subject being consumed and the other activities performed during learning with date and time. The Logger can also be used for error detection and correction. By tracking through the log files the reason for the failure can be uncovered.

\item{\textbf{Objective Test Taking:}}The Objective Test Taking provide the user/learner to assess the knowledge consumed using the framework app. The question along with four options is displayed when the user starts the test. Out of the four options one is the answer. The user has to select one option and proceed to next question. At the end of the test the result is displayed and also the user can verify the answers. The SQLite version 3.7 is used for storing the questions and answers. By clicking on the next button the next question and associated options are retrieved.


\item{\textbf{Interactive Objects:}}The interactive objects explorer provides the user with the various interactive objects to interact with and consume knowledge through the touch based interaction. This is implemented using the FLASH \& HTML support for mobile devices. The framework app lists the HTML interactive files stored on the SD card. The user can then select between those for learning. When a selection is made the HTML code triggers the respective SWF file and the interactive object is displayed. User can then interact using the touch and gain knowledge.

\end{itemize}

\section{Summary}
\hspace{0.5in}In this chapter we have described the formal technical reviews and the outcome of those. We have described the Test Plan which was successfully carried out at regular development phases.\\

%*******************t**********Chapter 9******************
\chapter{Technical Specifications}
\hspace*{0.5in}In this chapter we will discuss the advantages and limitations of the M-Learning Framework. We will also go through the applications of the framework and have a brief study about the technical requirements.
\section{Advantages}
\hspace*{0.5in}A key benefit of M-Learning is its potential for increasing productivity by making learning available anywhere, anytime. Because mobile devices have the power to make learning even more widely available and accessible, mobile devices are a natural extension of eLearning. M-Learning is the power of learning that is truly “just-in-time” where you could actually access training at the precise place and time on the job that you need. Our project provides the reusable piece of code that will help the developers for developing multiple M-Learning applications easily; one can also prepare audio or textual notes on move. The greatest benefit of this delivery is the combination of true interactivity coupled with portability.
\\Following are some more advantages of M-learning Framework:
\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Just in time learning:}Learning at the point of need.}
\item{\textbf{Ability to access learning (almost) everywhere:}This means down time can be leveraged for learning.}
\item{\textbf{Potential to be two way and multi-media:}Video, powerpoint, podcasts, and quizes are all potential outputs to iPhone devices. This provides a great deal of flexibility for mobile development.}
\item{\textbf{Potential for location based learning:}This means the phone can alert the person when they are near a potential learning experience based in the context in which the learning will be used–which potentially can help retention and return on investment.}
\end{itemize}

\section{Limitations}
\hspace*{0.5in}To participate in mobile learning one must have a tablet or mobile devices with android as its base operating system,these can have high ranges of cost, due to this reason it cannot be affordable by everybody in todays world.
\\
\hspace*{0.5in}Another aspect to be considered is the size of the device, this is only a challenge if one incorrectly plans mobile learning content to be nothing more than compressed eLearning. If your users are already using their mobile device that you plan to push learning to, your strategy should be what content do they need in the context of using the device. Add to that, the greatly improved displays, such as the OLED display on the DROID Incredible, and size isn't a detriment any more, but an advantage.

\section{Applications}
\hspace*{0.5in}The M-Learning framework can be used in following areas:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Institutions for teaching the learning material developed by the developer for mobile learning.}
\item{Students can study with ease.}
\item{The education application developer can use this framework for developing number of applications that can be imported on mobile devices.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hardware Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item{AMD/Intel Processor}
\item{2GB RAM for application development}
\item{Min. 16 GB Hard Disk}
\\
\item{Android Emulator for testing}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item{HTML5}
\item{Action Script}
\item{Java}
\item{XML}
\item{GIMP and Photoshop}
\end{itemize}

\section{Summary}
\hspace*{0.5in}In this chapter we were made aware of the various advantages of the framework and also the limitations of the project. We also saw the hardware and software requirements of the project.
%***************************Chapter 10**************
\chapter {Future Scope if any}

\hspace{0.5in}The project Artificially Intelligent Traffic Management System is useful in this digital learning age and has a bright future. Although we tried to deliver a project that meets the present requirements of the M-Learning Application Developers but there are endless future possibilities. Some are listed below:
\\
\begin{itemize}
\item{We visualize Maggie extension software where Teacher carries a tablet and it has a software plugin for streaming the tablet screen to a laptop or a computer which is connected to a projector. This extension is very useful as not all projectors have any connectors to share video display of tablet devices. And sharing tablet screen with large number of students is a real life need of teachers.}
\item{We visualize Maggie to be extended on Symbian \& BlackBerry platform to ensure wide spread coverage on wide variety of phone hardware.}
\item{Future extension of Maggie is possible to include a compiler that could take one layer off the currently low level tie up and allow users to code in language of their choice. Pretty much like .Net being a platform and then developers can chose the language they want.}
\item{Maggie will have a future where developers will be able to add their own plugins for the framework.}
\item{We visualize Maggie to allow export various format content like slideshows, SCORM, Facebook app format where the M-Learning apps can be embedded on Facebook walls. Possibilities are endless.}
\end{itemize}

%*****************************Chapter 11**********
\chapter{Conclusion}
\hspace*{0.5in}M-Learning concept was tossed during the early 1990's but was never brought in the implementations. We analyzed the need of the M-Learning Framework and conducted rigorous studies and researches. We understood the requirements of the M-Learning Application Developers and decided to design a framework which will match their needs and will ease their task of developing the applications. We have developed a M-Learning Framework for multiple Android Platforms which includes Android 2.2 (Froyo), Android 2.3 (Gingerbread), Android 3.0 (Honeycomb) and 4.0 (Ice cream sandwich). We have successfully tested the M-Learning applications developed using the M-Learning Framework on the above mentioned Android platforms.\\
\hspace*{0.5in}Identifying missing pieces in order to achieve a broader platform for M-Learning and developing those pieces into a pragmatic framework is the central theme for this project. A key objective of our project is to improve the knowledge level of individuals by developing learning process that is time efficient .The M-Learning framework is an abstract representation of the services and their interfaces that are used to construct an e-Learning system in its broadcast sense, focused on the support of distributed electronic learning systems.
